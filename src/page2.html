                SSN Instincts, since its inception in 2006, is one of the largest campus culutral fest in South India, attracting crowds of well over 10,000 students  from over 150 institutions of higher learning. Each year, an unique theme will be followed for defining fest based on which tagline, event name, the decoration of the campus and much more are decided. This year (2017), Team Instincts come up with the theme “Carnival” and the tagline “Ride the Roller Coaster”.  We need to develop a website to showcase the events, schedule and other details about  the cultural fest.  Since most of my previous website designs are just concepts and designed for my learnings, this was my first project that was implemented in real time. We designed and developed each features concurrently thus able to complete within the given time span

            <div class="p3">
                Since every year my college culturals website keeps on changing, we looked at how previous year design were made and how other top colleges’ culutral websites in our demography were made. We found that most of them used some random template designs which lack liveliness. Then we understood that should deliver a real time culutral fest experience in our website since it is the most important point of contact about the cultural fest.

            <div class="p3">
                For providing indistinguishable experience of exploring a carnival kind of experience in our website, we took the surface mimicry from the actual carnival arena and our college environment. We used various elements from the carnivals and our college in building components for the website. Our main idea was to create an environment which suits the theme. At the same time, it should trigger the user to explore more.
